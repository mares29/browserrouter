# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in BrowserRouter, please report it privately via email:

**mares.dev@icloud.com**

Do not open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

## What Counts as a Security Issue

- URL leakage (URLs being logged or transmitted somewhere)
- Unexpected network connections
- Privilege escalation
- Arbitrary code execution
- Data exposure to other apps

## Response

This is a solo-maintained project. I'll do my best to respond promptly, but there's no guaranteed SLA. Expect acknowledgment within a week for valid reports.

## Scope

Only the BrowserRouter application code is in scope. Issues with macOS itself, Swift, or system frameworks should be reported to Apple.
